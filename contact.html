<!--This is for Javi and where I left off in the video
Hello, when reading this note it is thursday the 16th of december. What I have done so far is add a actual about us page, it is not yet connected but everything on that page is now available. We should be good to continue the Part 3 video. I added a phot, a mission stateent from the google doc, and a button along with a picture. You need to decide what to do with the informaton on the main page since you now have a about us page. make a plan up and let me know so i can green light it with you. One of us might come up with a good idea so i think its good having two appovals unless the other person is busy so yerrrr. Looking back now at the main page i think we need a major rehaul and maybe even get rid of some stuff. We will have a about us page, a course page, and the main home. You need to tell your dad we need more context because we really are working with a little in my opinion. But i know we are both limited. I just hope he is impressed enough to fucking accept this and understand that we have down bad lives cuz we really do and want the experience and you allready know bruh. anyway its 3 fucking am and it's time to sleep.Oh by the way I did make some changes to the main page, messed with the fonts, sizes, and pictures, so that going forward all the websites should have a veryt simular look.
